# 🌸 PrettyPackets Lib

Welcome to the **PrettyPackets Compatibility Library**! 🎀  
This library is designed to simplify cross-framework support for **FiveM** developers working with **ESX**, **QBCore**, and **QBox**, as well as various inventory systems like **OX Inventory** and **QB Inventory**.

---

## ✨ Purpose

This library provides a unified and modular interface to:
- Support **multiple frameworks** (ESX, QBCore, QBox)
- Handle **inventory differences** (OX Inventory, QB Inventory)
- Allow smoother transitions and shared resource development between server types

It’s your go-to for writing **clean, adaptable code** without locking into a single ecosystem. 💻💕

## 📦 Features

- 🔌 **Dynamic framework detection** (auto or manual)
- 📁 **Abstracted inventory support** for OX/QB
- 🧠 Utility functions for commonly used patterns (e.g., player data, item usage)
- 🧼 Lightweight and modular for easy use in any script
